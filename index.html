you should use classes, which allow you to apply css rules  to multiple elements
allows for code reuse, and faster rendering
farthest right is a key selector

attribute begins with selector ^

body parser
const bodyParser = require ('bodyParser')
res.body  eleans up the element and puts the info in the body

nodemon automatically restarts the server when something is changed
npm run dev

you put the dev in the script key 

const MongoClient = require('mongoDB').MongoClient

MongoClient.connect('connection key', (err, client) => {
    app.get
})

app.get('/', (req,res) => {
    res.sendFile(__dirname +'/index.html')
})

 npm install express --save
create server.js sendFile
npm express --save
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

npm install bodyParser --save

const bodyParser = require('body-PArser')

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded([extended:true])

body parser helps to clean up a form, it is a middle ware that is activated with use
express is unopinionated so it uses it

const bodyParser = require('body-parser')

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended:true}))

stores the form info in the body of the form submittal

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send
})

<form action="">
    <fieldset>
    <legend>Day of week</legend>
    <label for="week">monday:</label>
    <input type="checkbox" name="day" id="week" value="Monday">
    <label for="week">tuesday:</label>
    <input type="checkbox" name="day" id="week" value="Monday">
    </fieldset>
</form>

<!-- 
<Doctype! html>
    <html lang = "en"> 
    <head>
         <meta charset = "UTF-8">
         <meta name = "viewport" content ="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

        both deal with how the browser fits the webpage to the specific device.  aspect deals with the browser window, and deviceaspect deals with different mobile devices
        
        @media all and  (min-device-aspect-ratio: 16/9) {

        }

for loop is for when you know the specified times you will iterate through
a for loop allows you to repeatedly execute a block of code for a specified number of times
intialization, conditional, updtae


automatically wrapped in a promise that resolves with that value
Promise.value(1)

createElement(div) it tells the dom to create memory in the dom but not to add it to the html yet
must use append

class MakeShow{
    constructor(genre){
        this.genre = genre
    }
    play(){}
}

object.hawOwnProperty is shen you don't wnat it to enumerate over it's inherited properties
object.defineProperty when you want to assign or modifiy a properties charactersitics like enumerate

higher 

a higher order function takes in another function as an argument, produces a function as a result or both
the function that is passed into the higher order function is a callback function
it eliminates the need for explicit loops and intermediate variablles

async means that the funciton will return a promise,

operator performs computations, and maniupulates values
keywords deal with flow execution and defines language constructs

cURL: CLI tool used with terminal, scripts or server side <code>
    - works with different OS, and protocols like http, ftp
    - 

    Fetch: JS promise based client side browser
    - http protocol
</code>

sdf

the object itself, or it won't know where to go

a keyword deals with the flow of execution and define language constructs
while orerators manipulate values, and perform computations
eqality operators, assignments, 

keyword - deal with flow of execution, and define language constructs
operators - perform computations and manipulate values

cURL - CLI tool works on server side, scripts terminals with different OS and protocols
fetch - is promised based JS API that runs on the browser
