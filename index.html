you should use classes, which allow you to apply css rules  to multiple elements
allows for code reuse, and faster rendering
farthest right is a key selector

attribute begins with selector ^

body parser
const bodyParser = require ('bodyParser')
res.body  eleans up the element and puts the info in the body

nodemon automatically restarts the server when something is changed
npm run dev

you put the dev in the script key 

const MongoClient = require('mongoDB').MongoClient

MongoClient.connect('connection key', (err, client) => {
    app.get
})

app.get('/', (req,res) => {
    res.sendFile(__dirname +'/index.html')
})

 npm install express --save
create server.js sendFile
npm express --save
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

npm install bodyParser --save

const bodyParser = require('body-PArser')

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded([extended:true])

body parser helps to clean up a form, it is a middle ware that is activated with use
express is unopinionated so it uses it

const bodyParser = require('body-parser')

app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended:true}))

stores the form info in the body of the form submittal

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send
})

<form action="">
    <fieldset>
    <legend>Day of week</legend>
    <label for="week">monday:</label>
    <input type="checkbox" name="day" id="week" value="Monday">
    <label for="week">tuesday:</label>
    <input type="checkbox" name="day" id="week" value="Monday">
    </fieldset>
</form>

        both deal with how the browser fits the webpage to the specific device.  aspect deals with the browser window, and deviceaspect deals with different mobile devices

for loop is for when you know the specified times you will iterate through
a for loop allows you to repeatedly execute a block of code for a specified number of times
intialization, conditional, updtae


automatically wrapped in a promise that resolves with that value
Promise.value(1)

createElement(div) it tells the dom to create memory in the dom but not to add it to the html yet
must use append

class MakeShow{
    constructor(genre){
        this.genre = genre
    }
    play(){}
}

object.hawOwnProperty is shen you don't wnat it to enumerate over it's inherited properties
object.defineProperty when you want to assign or modifiy a properties charactersitics like enumerate

higher 

a higher order function takes in another function as an argument, produces a function as a result or both
the function that is passed into the higher order function is a callback function
it eliminates the need for explicit loops and intermediate variablles

async means that the funciton will return a promise,

operator performs computations, and maniupulates values
keywords deal with flow execution and defines language constructs

cURL: CLI tool used with terminal, scripts or server side <code>
    - works with different OS, and protocols like http, ftp
    - 

    Fetch: JS promise based client side browser
    - http protocol
</code>

sdf

the object itself, or it won't know where to go

a keyword deals with the flow of execution and define language constructs
while orerators manipulate values, and perform computations
eqality operators, assignments, 

keyword - deal with flow of execution, and define language constructs
operators - perform computations and manipulate values

cURL - CLI tool works on server side, scripts terminals with different OS and protocols
fetch - is promised based JS API that runs on the browser

keyword - defines language constructs and deals with flow of executions
operators perform calculations an dman

selector specificity helps to determine which css rules are applied to a specific element when multiple css selectors target the same one.  The one one with the highest specificity is the one that is used

they all have to deal with client side storage but have different sizes and resolves
cookies are the only one that communicates to the server and sends things like analystics
l

seperate structure from skin, seperate content from container

the spread operator spreads out an array into values for the .min to accept

a promise represents a value that will be resolved now, some point in the future or never
.then is a method that has callbacks to be executed if the promise is resolved or there is an error
they are commonly used for asynchrosnus operations like reading a file, querying a database, or making http request

the viewport meta tag lets the browser know the width of the website should be the width of the viewport, good practice
to do it in the html as some browsers don't recognize the css code

git commit saves it to the local repository (staging area)

m is the message you save to go along with the commit so you know why it was done

git status, like stage! git log is for what is aved

change directory

paramater acts like a variable that is passed into a function in the form of an argument.

a for loop is a flow control structure that allows you to repeatedly execute a block of code a specified number o time
intialization, conditional, update

a math object is a built in object that acts as a namespace for mathmatecail methods to be stored in and used within javascript.  It acts as a container for these math matheical methods.
floor, ceil, min, max, random, pow, sqrt, round, abs

polymorphism

null, undefined, false, empty string, zero -zero, NaN

object,function, array, all can be empty, true, nonzero, string
infinity, -inifinity,

starts with ends with

it is a flow control structure that allows you to repeatedly execute a block of code a specific number of time
intial, ocndional, update
ls

a program is a set of instructions for the computer to understand an execute

functions the buiding blocks of programming.
they set of instructions and are reusable

if/else statements and switches

async is a promise to resolve a value, it will be accessible with the .then, .catch that attach callbacks based on whether the promise is reolved,rejected
if the value that is returned is a non-promise value it will be wrapped in a promise.resolve

key word defines language constructs, and control the flow of executions
operators manipulate values, and perform computations
they are programming mechanisms that control the order of executions of statements within a program

intialization, automatic execution, state definition, set up logic

initialization sets the initial, auto, state definitions gives the properti
initialization and state definition deal with the initial properties of the object to set it up, auto executed with new keyword
and set up logic like event listners loggin,

control flow structrues are programming mechanisms that allow
you to control the execution order of statements within a program

math.min..arr

function (arr){
    let minNum = arr[0]
}

constructor is used to tell what created and what type it is internal protopye deals with protytpal inheritance

abstraction betwcause it simplies the interface to interact with a complex system
to interact with a specific set of functionalities

encapsulation binds the data to the methos

seperates the internal implementations from the ext

`${name}`  + na

 a for loop allows you to repeatedly execute a code statement for a specified number of times
 initialization, conditional, update

list the files within the directory, la shows the hidden ones
